# Agile Methodology

### My Approach to Agile Methodology
As I developed this project, I used the Agile methodology because of its flexibility and iterative process. Agile helped me stay organized and adapt as the project evolved. Working in short, manageable cycles (or "sprints") allowed me to make continuous progress and improve each feature step-by-step. This approach gave me the structure I needed to regularly assess my progress and refine the app as I moved forward.

#### Benefits in Testing for Me:

Agile was especially beneficial for testing each function of my app. Since I worked in small increments, I was able to test each feature thoroughly as I completed it. This brought a lot of advantages:

- Quickly Finding Issues: By testing after each sprint, I caught bugs and issues early, avoiding larger problems down the line.
- Better Quality: Testing in each phase ensured that the app’s functionality met my standards before moving on to the next feature.
- Flexibility: As new ideas or changes came up, I was able to easily adjust the plan without losing track of the overall project.
- Continuous Improvement: Each testing cycle helped me fine-tune the app and my own development process, so I could deliver a more polished final product.

### MoSCoW Prioritization
To keep myself focused, I used the MoSCoW method to prioritize the tasks and features I needed to work on. I broke everything down into:

Must Have: Features that were critical to the app’s core functionality.
- Should Have: Important features that weren’t essential, but added significant value.
- Could Have: Features that would be nice to include if time allowed.
- Won’t Have: Features that I decided not to include in the current version.
This prioritization method helped me stay on track, ensuring that I worked on the most important features first and kept the project manageable.

### Managing with GitHub Projects
I used GitHub Projects to organize my tasks and track my progress. Each project board represented an EPIC (a major part of the app), and I created columns like "To Do," "In Progress," "On Hold," "Done," and "Bugs" to visualize where each task stood. I also used labels to categorize tasks based on their priority and organized them into sprints to stay on track.

### Visualizing Progress with the Kanban Board
I relied on a Kanban board to manage my progress. Seeing my tasks move through different stages—from "To Do" to "Done"—gave me a clear sense of accomplishment and kept me motivated throughout the project. It also helped me ensure that no task was overlooked or forgotten.

# EPICS
Each Epic in my project represented a major feature or functionality of the platform. By breaking these large tasks into smaller, manageable parts, I was able to tackle each piece step-by-step. This ensured that nothing was left incomplete, and every aspect of the app was thoroughly developed.

# Typography
I utilized Times New Roman for my site as this font is the most browser compatible font.

# Colour Scheme
I chose the Urban Chic color palette for the website to create a look that is sleek, modern, and dynamic, while still being welcoming and approachable. The black background is the main foundation, demonstrating sophistication. Black is often associated with strength and professionalism, and here it sets the design, creating a sense of seriousness and confidence. It sets the tone for a space where users feel they are engaging with something purposeful and refined.

White and light gray accents, such as #FFFFFF and #F5F5F5, create sense of balance and clarity to the design. These lighter colours ensure the interface remains clean and uncluttered, allowing users to focus on content without feeling overwhelmed. They bring elegance and act as a neutral canvas that highlights key information and visuals, making the website feel organized and intuitive.

The touch of gold (#FFAB00) and orange (#FF5722) add warmth and energy, drawing attention to important elements like buttons and call-to-action areas. gives the design with warmth and energy, bringing life and vibrancy to the overall aesthetic. Gold is often associated with optimism, creativity, and success, which aligns perfectly with the aspirations of the Rockfit App. It draws attention to crucial interactive elements like buttons and calls to action, inviting users to engage and explore further. Its presence adds a sense of luxury, signaling that the experience is not just functional but also enjoyable and rewarding.

By combining these colours, I wanted to create a design that is both stylish and functional. Black provides the solid, modern foundation, white and gray keep the layout clean and easy to navigate, and gold and orange offers just the right amount of energy and excitement to encourage exploration. Additionally, the hover effects, such as gold transitioning to silver, create dynamic interactions that make the design feel lively without overwhelming the user. Together, these elements work to ensure users feel both confident and inspired as they visit the Rockfit App.

# DataBase Diagram

The project's data model is based on an Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) that maps out the relationships between the different Django models. At the core is the User model, which extends Django's default User class with fields like id, username, password, and email. 

Registered Users can also leave reviews on Products, with fields for the content of the review, when it was created, and whether it’s been approved. There’s also a ContactMessage model, which allows visitors to send messages to the site admins.

### Relationships 
Fitness-Related Tables:<br>
fitness_userprofile and Other Tables<br>
Relationship: 1:N
One fitness_userprofile links with:
- fitness_order: A user can place multiple orders.
- fitness_wishlist: A user can have multiple wishlists.
- fitness_review: A user can write multiple product reviews.

fitness_wishlist and fitness_wishlistitem
Relationship: 1:N
- One fitness_wishlist contains multiple fitness_wishlistitem.

<br>

fitness_product and fitness_order<br>
Relationship: M:N
- Products are ordered by multiple users. This would likely require an intermediary table (e.g., fitness_order_items), though it's not explicitly listed.


<br>
fitness_subscriptionplan and fitness_userprofile<br>
Relationship: 1:N

- One subscription plan (e.g., monthly, yearly) can apply to multiple users.
<br>
<br>

Shopping Cart Tables:<br>

cart_cart and cart_cartitem<br>
Relationship: 1:N
- One shopping cart (cart_cart) contains multiple cart items (cart_cartitem).

<br>
cart_cartitem and fitness_product<br>
Relationship: 1:N

- Each cart item (cart_cartitem) refers to a single fitness_product.

# Bugs
I deployed the website on Heroku in the United States region instead of the European region, this can affect performance speeds.

# Deployment
This website is deployed to Heroku from a GitHub repository, the following steps were taken:

#### Creating Repository on GitHub
- First make sure you are signed into [Github](https://github.com/) and go to the code institutes template, which can be found [here](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Org/gitpod-full-template).
- Then click on **use this template** and select **Create a new repository** from the drop-down. Enter the name for the repository and click **Create repository from template**.
- Once the repository was created, I clicked the green **gitpod** button to create a workspace in gitpod so that I could write the code for the site.

#### Creating an app on Heroku
- After creating the repository on GitHub, head over to [heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) and sign in.
- On the home page, click **New** and **Create new app** from the drop down.
- Give the app a name(this must be unique) and select a **region** I chose **Europe** as I am in Europe, Then click **Create app**.

#### Create a database 
- Log into [CIdatabase maker](https://www.heroku.com/](https://dbs.ci-dbs.net/))
- add your email address in input field and submit the form
- open database link in your email
- paste dabase URL in your DATABASE_URL variable in env.py file and in Heroku config vars

#### Deploying to Heroku.
- Head back over to [heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) and click on your **app** and then go to the **Settings tab**
- On the **settings page** scroll down to the **config vars** section and enter the **DATABASE_URL** which you will set equal to the elephantSQL URL, create **Secret key** this can be anything,
**CLOUDINARY_URL** this will be set to your cloudinary url and finally **Port** which will be set to 8000.
- Then scroll to the top and go to the **deploy tab** and go down to the **Deployment method** section and select **Github** and then sign into your account.
- Below that in the **search for a repository to connect to** search box enter the name of your repository that you created on **GitHub** and click **connect**
- Once it has been connected scroll down to the **Manual Deploy** and click **Deploy branch** when it has deployed you will see a **view app** button below and this will bring you to your newly deployed app.
- Please note that when deploying manually you will have to deploy after each change you make to your repository.
